# Introduction to the bookboon.com API

The bookboon.com API (the "API") ...

## Using the API
The API is divided into two logical parts, one that requires an API key and one that does not. If you require an API key you can request one by mailing and explaining your project to [tbm@bookboon.com](mailto:tbm@bookboon.com). Please note that we reserve the right to deny API keys to any given project.
