# Introduction to the bookboon.com API

The bookboon.com API (the "API") ...

## Using the API
The API is divided into two logical parts, one that requires an API key and one that does not. If you require an API key you can request one by mailing and explaining your project to [tbm@bookboon.com](mailto:tbm@bookboon.com). Please note that we reserve the right to deny API keys to any given project.

The user should always be directed to download the books from bookboon.com servers directly, it is not permitted to store or cache the books on your or any other servers. This has the added bonus of saving you tons of bandwidth - if you don't believe us look at [this graph](http://bookboon.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/traffic-graph.png).
